# SymbiAid FutureHack 2018

With rapidly aging population, social and economic implications are becoming apparent as our communities grow less sustainable. Our project is focused on resolving several  social and economic implications by implementing a Blockchain solution to help volunteers, as well as others, to contribute to their communities, by helping the elderly or others in need. Our goal is to improve social well-being and encourage solidarity between individuals by providing a blockchain-based social platform, where people can instantly ask for help, without an intermediary.
